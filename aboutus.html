<p>Connect is a popular free social networking website that allows registered users to create profiles, upload photos and video, send messages and keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues.<br>Within each member's personal profile, there are several key networking components. The most popular is arguably the Wall, which is essentially a virtual bulletin board. Messages left on a member's Wall can be text, video or photos. Another popular component is the virtual Photo Album. Photos can be uploaded from the desktop or directly from a smartphone camera. There is no limitation on quantity, but Connect staff will remove inappropriate or copyrighted images.  An interactive album feature allows the member's contacts (who are called generically called "friends") to comment on each other's photos and identify (tag) people in the photos. Another popular profile component is status updates, a microblogging feature that allows members to broadcast short Twitter-like announcements to their friends. All interactions are published in a news feed, which is distributed in real-time to the member's friends.

<p>Have you ever wondered why people like using Connect? After all, there are already lots of other ways to communicate online, such as email, instant messaging, and so on. What makes Connect unique is the ability to connect and share with the people you care about at the same time.

For many, having a Connect account is now an expected part of being online, much like having your own email address. And since Connect is so popular, other websites have worked to integrate Connect This means you can use a single Connect account to sign in to different services across the Web.
</p>
<p>Connect is a vast, sprawling network and you can make whatever you want of it. You sign up by putting some details, and preferably a photo of yourself, on the Connect website. Then you are ready to start posting a few updates.

These updates are statements about what you are up to, links to interesting stuff you have seen elsewhere on the web - its up to you. As word gets around that you are online, you will find old friends start to get in touch. They may have heard about you being on Connect or they may have found you after doing a search.

Connect itself will send notes on people you might know, based on the fact that you went to the same school or college or shared an employer (you only have to put up as much of this sort of information as you want).
